## Introduction

Welcome to our repository for our project submission to the World Robotic Olympiad (WRO) 
in the category of future-engineering competition. In this project we aim to design an 
autonomous vehicle that can navigate around a field with various rules and restrictions 
depending on the rounds. Our goal is to create a highly efficient, dependable, and versatile 
vehicle capable of performing complex tasks autonomously.

## Mobility Management

### 1.Chassis
  - Material: Plastic (pla+ from esun)
  - Description: The chassis for our vehicle is designed with plastic to ease the design and
    prototyping process. The use of 3D printing with plastic helps us keep the chassis lightweight.
    It also includes mounting points for the various parts of the vehicle, reducing the need for a
    separate mounting plate. Plastic offers a balance of strength, flexibility, and lightness, crucial
    for efficient vehicle movement and stability. Additionally, the choice of plastic allows for easy
    modifications and quick iterations during the development phase, which is essential for refining
    the design based on testing and performance feedback.
    
### 2.Wheels_and_Motor  
  - Wheels: 69916 TAMIYA Robot Sports Tire
      - 69916 TAMIYA Robot Sports Tire is a small rubber tire that is made to be in a miniature robot.
        The size of the wheels provide our vehicle with a more compact design which helps in parking
        the robot in the obstacle challenge round, in which we have to park the vehicle in a certain
        spot that is quite limited.
  - Motor: 6V 440RPM DC Micro Metal Gearmotor
      - This motor offer a powerful rotaion in a small sizes that we see as beneficial in our robot
        as it need to meet certain condition in this compettion. The high power that this motor offer
        us will help the robot navigate the obstacle course in break-neck speed which is good as we
        want it to excel in all aspect of the compettition and if the deciding factor came down to time
        then we will at least be able to trust the robot to perform at it's peak.

### 3.Steering_Mechanism  
   - MG90S Metal Gear Micro Servo
       - We decide to use this servo because it posses a lot of gear which helps in refining our control
         and the precision of the robot which is crutial when making turn at an extreme angle to avoid
         obstacles in quick succession. We especcially selected this servo in place of a normal servo
         because of it's precision when compare to common servo that are seen commonly.

## Power_and_Sensor_Management  
### Processing Unit  
- **Raspberry pi**
  - **Reason:** A raspberry pi is used to process the video from the camera which calculate
    where and in what direction the vehicle should headed. The Raspberry Pi also connected
    to the Arduino nano and issue commands to it to lessen the load on the Raspberry Pi itself
    as it's already processing the algorithms for driving and the images from the Pi camera.

### Vision System
- **Raspberry pi camera**
  - **Reason:**  The Raspberry Pi camera integrates easily with the Raspberry Pi and provides
    clear, detailed images, making it a good choice for our vehicle. The camera's high resolution
    and fast frame rate ensure that the Raspberry Pi receives timely and accurate visual data,
    which is crucial for making real-time navigation decisions. The camera's compatibility with
    the Pi also simplifies the hardware setup, enhancing system reliability.
    
### Distance Sensing  
- **RPLIDAR C1**
  - We selected teh RPLIDAR C1 as our vision system because if it's ability to detect object
    in a 360 degree and take up to 5,000 samples per seconds, combine with it's range of 12
    meter this sensor will help us improve the navigational abilities of our autonomous vehicle.
    We see the need to use this sensor from our previous test that a normal infared sensors can
    malfunction when placed in environments that have high amount of infared lights (outdoor,
    old lightbulb).

### Color sensing
- **Light Sensor TC01**
    - We implement these light sensors to have a better tracking of the obstacle cource and
      the direction that the vehicle is moving in. The main purpose of the light sensors is
      to detected the orange and blue line that indicate the direction of turning. We decide
      to use two of these sensors obecause it give us better tracking of which color line come
      first.

### Power Supply
- **lithium ion batteries**
  - **Reason:** two lithium-ion cells provide the necessary voltage to power all our electronics
    and is rechargeable, reducing waste compared to disposable batteries. The battery's high energy
    and rechargeability make it an efficient power source for the vehicle's prolonged uses and the
    power consumption that come with the various electronics.

### Orientation and Motion Sensing
- **BNO055**
  - **Reason:** The BNO055 sensor measures acceleration and orientation, improving
    the vehicle's navigational ability and reducing the load on the host processor.
    It combines accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data for accurate orientation
    information, crucial for precise control. The sensor's ability to provide real-time
    orientation data helps the vehicle maintain its intended path and respond accurately
    to changes in direction. This is especially important in dynamic environments where
    the vehicle needs to make quick adjustments to avoid obstacles and stay on course.

### Motor Control
- **Maker Drive**
  - **Reason:** To control the motor, we implement a Maker Drive to regulate the power
    and direction of the motor. This motor driver provides efficient and reliable
    control over the motor's speed and direction, essential for smooth and precise
    vehicle movement.

### Microprocessor
- **Arduino nano**
  - **Reason:** The Arduino nano are connected to various electronics(Maker Drive, Raspberry pi,
    BNO055) and help control all of it for the raspberry pi. The Nano serves as an intermediary,
    handling lower-level tasks and offloading some processing from the Raspberry Pi.

## Obstacle_Management  
### Open Challenge  
In the open challenge, our vehicle must drive around a field within a time limit 3 minute and
in a total of 3 laps around the field, additionally must not come into contact with the walls 
of the field. The vehicle also must not come into contact with the walls whether it be the 
inner or outer walls.

### Obstacle Challenge  
In the obstacle challenge, our vehicle will also needed to complete the requirement as said above,
but the vehicle will also need to avoid additional pillars of green and red that is scatter around
the field. The pillars also have it's individual rules that the vehicle must obey plus a now designated
area for parking the vehicle.

## Simulator
Before we implement the vehicleâ€™s code into the actual robot, we need to test if the code can work first.
Our solution to this is to create a simulator to test the code in Godot.

**Code's_Repository**  
The repository for our vehicle's code can be found at:
[https://github.com/Chayanon-Ninyawee/KMIDS-TDF-WRO-Future-Engineers-2024-Simulator.git](https://github.com/Chayanon-Ninyawee/KMIDS-TDF-WRO-Future-Engineers-2024-Simulator/tree/main/PythonScripts) 
The repository contains the actual code for the vehicle that's going to be used in the coming competition.
