## Mobility Management
  
1. Chassis  
We design the chassis using Autodesk Inventor and printed it with 3D printer
to create customised car that suit our need for a vehicle that can house
various sensor within it without the restriction that can be seen in vehicle
made from lego parts or EV3

2. Concept  
We incorporate the steering ackerman to make the car turn without the tire slipping
when turning corners

3. Motor(s)  
We use a single TT Motor to provide because of the power that it can
generate. We put the motor in the middle of the vehicle and connected
it to a differentian made from lego to provide power to the two back-wheel
and avoid unnecessary waste of space. Our vehicle use a single servo at the
front bridge to turn the front wheel.

## Power and Sensor Management
- We incorporate 4 ultrasonic sensors at each side of the vehicle(front , back,
left and right)
- We have a camera at the front of the vehicle
- We use 1 lithium ion battry to power the whole vehicle
- We have a Maker Drive to distribute the power to the motors in the back wheels
- We use Raspberry pi to process the video taken by the camera
- We have an arduino to manage the control of the motors and the servo at the front bridge
- A BNO055 help us keep track of the acceleration of the vehicle
