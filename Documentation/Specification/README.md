## Chassis
  - Material: Plastic (pla+ from esun)
  - Description: The chassis for our robot is made with 3D printer to facilitate a chassis that
    is durable and flexible to endure the stress that is put on it in the competition. The 3D
    printer also allowed us to prototype various parts in quick succession, creating an effective
    workflow.
