## Printing
- downloaded the [3D Cura files](https://github.com/Chayanon-Ninyawee/KMIDS-TDF-WRO-Future-Engineers-2024/tree/402e0bc6fe819bc5726d7b25003a4c2b3e62147d/Cura-Files) for printing
- Use PLA as your material
- Print all the parts

## Assembling
When assembling the robot, you can generally follow how it is assemble in our [3D model](https://github.com/Chayanon-Ninyawee/KMIDS-TDF-WRO-Future-Engineers-2024/tree/402e0bc6fe819bc5726d7b25003a4c2b3e62147d/KMIDS-TDF-WRO2024-FreeCAD) but some parts
require additional note when assembling.

### Back Wheels
When assembling the back wheels it is recomended that you have a screw driver with you when
installing the back wheel stopper. The back wheel stopper needed to have something preventing
it from screwing towards the body. We inserted the screwdriver between them and then screw in
the screw, this make sures that the stopper will not be too tight and prevent the back wheels
from spinning freely.
