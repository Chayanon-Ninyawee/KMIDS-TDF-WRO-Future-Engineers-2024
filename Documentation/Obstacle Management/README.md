## Obstacle Management  

### Obstacle Challenge  
In the obstacle challenge, our robot will also needed to complete the requirement as said above, but the robot will also need to avoid additional pillars of green and red that is scatter around the field. The pillars also have it's individual rules that the robot must obey plus a now designated
area for parking the robot.

### Parking strategy
We planned to make the robot drive it's back side into the parking area because we design the robot to be long enough so that it can park perfectly within the area without the robot's lenght exceeding the width of the parking zone.
