## How to Install

Get FreecAD from the [realthunder](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases) version and choose an asset that fits your operating system.

## Window 11
One of our members used Windows 11, and then he had to click and download the asset that fit with Windows 11. For example, [FreeCAD-Link-Stable-Win-x86_64-py3.11-20241003.7z file](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases/download/20241003stable/FreeCAD-Link-Stable-Win-x86_64-py3.11-20241003.7z-SHA256.txt)


To be able to run Freecad, after successfully downloading, we extracted all files by clicking right click and choose "Extract all files" option. Finally, click the RunFreeCad in the asset folder to run Freecad.
## Linux
