# 3D Model
Our 3D model was created using FreeCAD from the [realthunder](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases) version, an open-source CAD software that provides broad accessibility for developers in the field of 3D modeling. The model can be viewed in the file [KMIDS-TDF-WRO2024-FreeCAD](https://github.com/Chayanon-Ninyawee/KMIDS-TDF-WRO-Future-Engineers-2024/tree/main/KMIDS-TDF-WRO2024-FreeCAD) by opening the [MainAssembly](https://github.com/Chayanon-Ninyawee/KMIDS-TDF-WRO-Future-Engineers-2024/tree/main/KMIDS-TDF-WRO2024-FreeCAD/MainAssembly) and exported into [STL file](https://github.com/Chayanon-Ninyawee/KMIDS-TDF-WRO-Future-Engineers-2024/tree/main/STL-Files). We use Cura for slicing the models and convert them into [Cura file](https://github.com/Chayanon-Ninyawee/KMIDS-TDF-WRO-Future-Engineers-2024/tree/main/Cura-Files) for preparing printing the chassis of our robot by using `Creality Ender-3 V3 printer`, though other 3D printer can work as well.

# How to Install FreeCad

- Download FreeCAD realthunder branch [here](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases). 
- Choose an asset that is appropriate for you operating system.

## Window 11/10
 - Click and download the asset link that is appropriate with Windows 11. For example, [FreeCAD-Link-Stable-Win-x86_64-py3.11-20241003.7z file](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases/download/20241003stable/FreeCAD-Link-Stable-Win-x86_64-py3.11-20241003.7z-SHA256.txt)
- Extracted all files by clicking right click and choose "Extract all files" option. 
- Double click the RunFreeCad in the asset folder to run FreeCAD.
## Linux
- Click and download the asset link [org.freecadweb.FreeCAD.Link.Stable_20241003.flatpak](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases/download/20241003stable/org.freecadweb.FreeCAD.Link.Stable_20241003.flatpak)
- Then, run Freecad when download is done.
# FreeCad
- It is opne-source 3D modeler software which is free to use. It supports a wide range of plugins and add-ons, and we can create their own modules to extend its functionality. Whether we're designing simple or complex parts, FreeCAD can be adapted to our needs. It is also cross-platform that allow us to run in any operating system suhc as, Windoe, MacOS, an Linux easily. Moreover, FreeCAD is a great choice for 3D printing, allowing us to create models and export them in formats like [STL file](https://github.com/Chayanon-Ninyawee/KMIDS-TDF-WRO-Future-Engineers-2024/tree/main/STL-Files) and offers tools for checking models to make sure that they can be printed successfully. 
# Cura
- Like FreeCad, Cura is open-source software. It has an interface that allows us to use it easily. Its simple setup process allows us to quickly prepare printing 3D models without extensive learning. It also offers advanced slicing options for experienced users. Here is the [Cura file](https://github.com/Chayanon-Ninyawee/KMIDS-TDF-WRO-Future-Engineers-2024/tree/main/Cura-Files) that we use to print.
# Creality Ender 3D V3
- We decide to use the Creality Ender 3 V3 for 3D printing. It appeals to beginner and expert users. Not only is its price affordable, but it also does not take too long to produce high-quality prints with good detail and precision. It also supports various filament types (PLA, ABS, PETG, TPU, and others). In our case, we use PLA plastic due to its lightweight and easy modification during building the robot.
