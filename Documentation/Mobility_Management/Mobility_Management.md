## Mobility Management
### 1. Driving mechanism
The robot use a steering ackerman to steer the robot left and right. We choose to use this
method because it mimick what car actually use to steer. Due to our freedom to choose how
to build our robot we can choose to build the robot to be as realistic as possible without
the limitation that a lego sets will presents.

### 2. Robot Design
The robot is made to be quite short because of our RPLidar C1 which needs to be at the height
of the obstacles and walls to be able to detect them, due to this the robot is not as tall
as other robots. We decided to use traditional car design as the base of our robot as it
provide easy visualization on how the movement of the robot and with the 4 wheels we can
reduce slippage of wheels. The weight of the robot is mostly concentrated in the middle
because of the placement of the batteries which resulted in the robot having an ideal center
of gravity that will ensure that the robot will not lift of from the arena.
