# Mobility Management
## Chassis
* **Material:** Plastic (pla+ from esun)
* **Description:** The chassis for our vehicle is designed with plastic to ease the design and prototyping process. The use of 3D printing with plastic helps us keep the chassis lightweight. It also includes mounting points for the various parts of the vehicle, reducing the need for a separate mounting plate. Plastic offers a balance of strength, flexibility, and lightness, crucial for efficient vehicle movement and stability. Additionally, the choice of plastic allows for easy modifications and quick iterations during the development phase, which is essential for refining the design based on testing and performance feedback.

## Wheels and Motor
* **Wheels:** four high traction rubber wheels Motor: a single TT motor
* **Description:** We use a single DC motor to power the two back wheels due to its high-power output. It is connected to a differential to help distribute power to the back wheels as needed, ensuring smooth and efficient power distribution. The rubber wheels provide a grip on surfaces, preventing slippage and improving overall performance. The use of high-traction rubber ensures that the vehicle can maneuver effectively on various surfaces encountered during the competition. The differential mechanism is crucial for maintaining balance and stability, especially when the vehicle makes sharp turns.


## Steering Mechanism
* **Servo motor:** The servo motor in the front bridge of our vehicle allows for sharp cornering and precise steering control. This mechanism is critical for navigating tight spaces and obstacles efficiently. The servo motor's ability to provide fine control over the steering angle enhances the vehicle's agility, making it adept at avoiding obstacles and navigating through challenging courses. The integration of the servo motor into the front bridge design also ensures that the steering system is responsive, capable of handling sudden changes in direction without compromising stability.
