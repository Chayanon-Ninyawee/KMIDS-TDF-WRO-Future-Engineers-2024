## Introduction
Welcome to our repository for our project submission to the World Robotic Olympiad (WRO) in the category of future-engineering competition. In this project we aim to design an autonomous vehicle that can navigate around a field with various rules and restrictions depending on the rounds. Our goal is to create a highly efficient, dependable, and versatile vehicle capable of performing complex tasks autonomously.
